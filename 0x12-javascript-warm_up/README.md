# 0x12-javascript-warm_up

This repository contains JavaScript scripts that demonstrate various concepts and tasks related to JavaScript programming. Each script is designed to solve a specific problem or showcase a particular feature of JavaScript.

## List of Scripts

1. [0-javascript_is_amazing.js](0-javascript_is_amazing.js): This script prints the string "JavaScript is amazing" to the console using the console.log() function. It demonstrates the usage of constant variables in JavaScript.
2. [1-multi_languages.js](1-multi_languages.js): This script prints three lines to the console, each containing a different programming language. The lines printed are "C is fun", "Python is cool", and "JavaScript is amazing". It demonstrates the usage of console.log() and multiline string printing.
3. [2-arguments.js](2-arguments.js): This script prints a message based on the number of command-line arguments passed to it. If no arguments are passed, it prints "No argument". If one argument is passed, it prints "Argument found". Otherwise, it prints "Arguments found". It utilizes the process.argv array to access command-line arguments.
4. [3-value_argument.js](3-value_argument.js): This script prints the first command-line argument passed to it. If no arguments are provided, it prints "No argument". It demonstrates the usage of command-line arguments and conditional statements.
5. [4-concat.js](4-concat.js): This script prints two command-line arguments passed to it in the format "arg1 is arg2". If fewer than two arguments are provided, it prints "undefined is undefined". It showcases string concatenation in JavaScript.
6. [5-to_integer.js](5-to_integer.js): This script prints the first command-line argument converted to an integer. If the argument cannot be converted, it prints "Not a number". It demonstrates type conversion and validation in JavaScript.
7. [6-multi_languages_loop.js](6-multi_languages_loop.js): This script prints three lines using an array of strings and a loop. The lines printed are the same as in script 1, "C is fun", "Python is cool", and "JavaScript is amazing". It showcases array iteration using a loop.
8. [7-multi_c.js](7-multi_c.js): This script prints the string "C is fun" a specified number of times. The number of occurrences is passed as a command-line argument. If no argument or a non-integer argument is provided, it prints "Missing number of occurrences". It demonstrates looping based on command-line arguments.
9. [8-square.js](8-square.js): This script prints a square of a specified size using the character 'X'. The size is passed as a command-line argument. If no argument or a non-integer argument is provided, it prints "Missing size". It demonstrates nested looping and string manipulation.
10. [9-add.js](9-add.js): This script prints the addition of two integers passed as command-line arguments. If fewer than two arguments are provided, it prints "NaN" (Not a Number). It demonstrates the usage of functions and addition operation in JavaScript.
11. [10-factorial.js](10-factorial.js): This script computes and prints the factorial of an integer passed as a command-line argument. If no argument or a non-integer argument is provided, it prints "1". It uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial.
12. [11-second_biggest.js](11-second_biggest.js): This script searches for the second biggest integer among the command-line arguments. If no argument or a single argument is provided, it prints "0". It demonstrates array manipulation and conditional statements.
13. [12-object.js](12-object.js): This script updates the value of a property in an object. It replaces the value "12" with "89". It showcases object manipulation in JavaScript.
14. [13-add.js](13-add.js): This script exports a function called "add" that performs the addition of two integers. It demonstrates the usage of modules and exporting functions in JavaScript.
