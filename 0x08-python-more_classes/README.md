# Tasks

This repository contains solutions to various programming tasks. Each task is implemented in Python and follows specific requirements.

## Task 1: Print a Square

Implement a Python function that prints a square using the '#' character. The size of the square is determined by the input parameter.

## Task 2: Print a Square (with size validation)

Extend the previous task by validating the size parameter to ensure it is an integer greater than 0. If the size is invalid, an exception should be raised.

## Task 3: Print a Square (with size validation and error messages)

Further extend the previous task by providing detailed error messages for invalid size parameters. The error messages should indicate whether the size is not an integer or if it is less than or equal to 0.

## Task 4: Evaluate a Postfix Expression

Implement a Python function that evaluates a postfix expression using a stack. The postfix expression is provided as a string, and the function should return the result of the evaluation.

## Task 5: Create a Queue Class

Create a Python class that represents a queue. The class should have methods for enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is empty.

## Task 6: Implement a Singly Linked List

Implement a Python class that represents a singly linked list. The class should have methods for adding elements to the list, removing elements from the list, and checking if the list is empty.

## Task 7: Implement a Rectangle Class

Create a Python class that represents a rectangle. The class should have private attributes for width and height, as well as methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

## Task 8: Extend the Rectangle Class

Extend the previous task by adding additional functionality to the Rectangle class. This includes class attributes for tracking the number of instances and a symbol for string representation, as well as a static method for comparing rectangles based on area.

## Task 9: Further Extend the Rectangle Class

Further extend the Rectangle class by adding a class method for creating a square rectangle, where the width and height are equal.

## Task 10: Solve the N-Queens Puzzle

Write a program that solves the N-Queens puzzle, which involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The program should take the value of N as a command line argument and print every possible solution to the problem.
