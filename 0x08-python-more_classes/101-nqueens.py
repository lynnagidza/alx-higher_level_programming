N-Queens Puzzle Solver

This program solves the N-queens problem, which is the challenge of placing N
non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage:
    nqueens N

    - If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, it
    prints "Usage: nqueens N",
      followed by a new line, and exits with the status 1.
    - N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
      - If N is not an integer, it prints "N must be a number", followed by a
      new line, and exits with the status 1.
      - If N is smaller than 4, it prints "N must be at least 4", followed by
      a new line, and exits with the status 1.

The program prints every possible solution to the N-queens problem, with one
solution per line.
The solutions are printed in the format: [[row_1, col_1], [row_2, col_2], ...]

You are only allowed to import the sys module.
